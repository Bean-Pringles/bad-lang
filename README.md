# Current Ideas

Make a lang where each file called 1.txt or like 37.txt is one line, so it reads the first line and assembles Python from that 

Where the way you code is ascii smiley faces

Commands are key smashes 

Write code backwards 

A Minecraft repl with Minecraft commands except they have an alternate way of running a command (instead of Minecraft’s /run it just runs the script )

Shopping list where each thing is like eggs, milk, and whatnot

A haiku language where each 3 lines must be a certain set of syllables 

Python but each line only runs if a coin decides it can.

Executes comments but ignores actual code
